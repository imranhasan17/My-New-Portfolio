            <p>With a name like "Webdesigner Depot," it's no wonder that this design news site is visually appealing.
      
              One thing that we particularly like is the responsive images on each individual post. The subtle motion of the image as readers scroll over a range of articles helps catch visitors' eyes.
              
              And check out the effective use of the featured image to highlight the most recent article. This approach pulls the viewer immediately into the blog's most recent content.
              
              What's more, the color scheme, background, and fonts are all consistent â€” which keeps this blog looking professional, but still distinct from the basic blog templates you might be used to seeing.</p>
